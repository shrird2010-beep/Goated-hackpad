# Goated-hackpad
The goated hackpad is my version of the hackpad that is going to be used to run some basic games. I have tried to follow the ASWD format with an extra key that i could use for other features. Currently it has 4 lights, 5 buttons, and an OLED that makes it that little bit better.
## Features
- 4 lights to give a rgb effect
- A big 0.91" OLED screen!
- kmk firmware! Control your mouse with this macropad
- A cool name!
